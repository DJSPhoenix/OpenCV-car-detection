# Real-Time Vehicle Detection using Open-CV

The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(Car) in video frames and to keep tracking the same object. This is an example of how to detect vehicles in Python.

# Why Vehicle Detection?

For our project of autonomous drone valet parking, we need to detect the cars which our coming into our parking lot. Hence guiding them towards parking spaces.
